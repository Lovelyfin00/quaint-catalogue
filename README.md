# Welcome to quaint catalogue! üõçÔ∏è
Hey there, fellow shopaholics! This is my amazing ecommerce website built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I wanted to put my skills to the test and create an online store that is both functional and visually stunning. I used Bootstrap as my CSS framework and added some extra pizzazz with Swiper JS for some categories. Plus, I fetched product data from dummyjson.com to populate my website with tons of awesome products! <b>You can view the live website [here](https://lovelyfin00.github.io/quaint-catalogue/)</b>

## Features
My website has everything you need for a seamless online shopping experience! Here are some of the cool features:

- A super cool home page with hot deals that uses swiperjs and featured products to get you started
- An easy to use sidebar that shows different categories of product
- Product pages with all the details you need to make an informed purchase and it uses aos for seamless scrolling animations
- A shopping cart that keeps track of your items as you shop
- A checkout process that lets you choose shipping and payment options
- An order confirmation page to seal the deal and get you excited for your new goodies!
